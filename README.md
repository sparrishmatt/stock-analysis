# Stock-analysis

## Analysis Overview
The goal of this analysis was to create a report in Excel using VBA which will be able to analyze stock market changes by year. The output sheet for this project includes stock starting prices, ending prices, total daily volume, as well as percent changes by year. 

A secondary goal of this was to refactor already created code in order to speed up our analysis macros in case the dataset was enlarged. Any future changes to the dataset such as adding more stocks or years to be analyzed are accounted for as long as no changes are made to the VBA code.
